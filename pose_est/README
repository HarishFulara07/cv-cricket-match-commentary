Fine-Tuning Human Pose Estimations in Videos
============================================
This implementation is provided by the authors of [1].


NOTE
====
In this implementation we have seeded the randomization to produce consistent results in every run.
The obtained performance score can be very marginally different from mentioned in the paper.


Using the code
==============
The code is provided in MATLAB and is self-sufficient to run for full human parsing.
For upper body parsing, half body datasets like Poses in the Wild [3] can be downloaded and tested.

- start matlab in code directory

- run "run_full" to run full body parsing on a sample video sequence from our dataset.
  (To validate: sample sequence "test7" should give a final PCK score : 65.50% and post-processor PCK : 66.28%)

- run "run_half" to run upper body parsing. This code needs dataset and gt annotations and WILL NOT run straight-away.
  Half body datasets like Poses in the Wild [3] and VideoPose [4] can be downloaded and evaluated.

- The final output will be stored in "CACHE/test_dir/detections_final".
