# Features

1. 52 vector points corresponding to the pose.
2. Orientation of the bat.

# Steps

1. Segregate action frames - if would be best if we can get the frame where the batsman plays the shot or just before playing the shot or just after playing the shot.
2. Extract out batsman from the action frame.
3. Annotate the videos (Not enough videos on youtube).
4. Compute pose using pre downloaded code - 52 vector points corresponding to the pose.
5. [OPTIONAL] Get orientation of the bat.
6. Train a ML model.

# EVALUATION

Run the whole pipeline on a video.

# LIMITATIONS

1. Only batsman should be in the frame for proper pose detection. If keeper is close to the wickets, this is very difficult. System is good for fast bowling - when keeper is behind.
